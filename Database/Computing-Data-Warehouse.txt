Data Warehouse
	Abbreviations:
		DBMS:				DataBase Management System.

		OLAP: 				OnLine Analytics Processing.
	
	Description:
		A Database that focuses on the efficient analysis of Historical or Commutative Data gathered from different Data Sources.

	Concepts:
		Fact:				A Measurable Quantity representing something about the managed Entity or System. Calculations can be made on these for additional insight.
		Dimension: 			A Descriptive Item describing the 'Who', 'What', 'When' or 'Where' of a Fact.

		Record: 			Collection of related values pertaining to some Facts or Dimension.
		Table: 				Collection of Records with the same defined Facts or Dimension.

		OLAP: 				An approach to quickly serve Analytics Oriented Implementations (i.e. Business Intelligence Applications).
		OLAP Hypercube:		Refers to the Multi-Dimensional 'Cube-like' Data Structure involved in OLAP.

		Data Mart:			A subsidiary of a Data Warehouse to cater to a certain group of Users.
	
	Details:
		Data Warehouses focus on efficiently serving complex, Multi-Dimensional Queries as part of OLAP.
			Characteristics:
				Subject-Oriented: Each Data Warehouse consolidates Data relating to some theme.
				Integrated: The Data, potentially from multiple sources, must be integrated and transformed into a consistent format.
				Time-Variant: The Primary Keys of Data stored within should implicitly or explicitly contain an element of Time, as it is Historical or Commutative Data.
				Non-Volatile: Data is Read Only.
				
				Un-Normalized: Data is not Normalized so as to allow for faster Querying (i.e less and simpler Table Joins). 
					However, this also results in Data Redundancy within the Table Records.

		OLAP Cube:
			Table Types:
				Fact Table: Records in these contain Measurable Data on collection of Facts, as well as references to related Dimension Tables.
				Dimension Table: A companion to the Fact Table, Records in these contain Descriptive Data on the Facts in the Records that they are linked to.

			Schema Types:
				Star Schema
				Snowflake Schema: The Normalized Form of a Star Schema. Hierarchies are further separated into other Tables.
				Galaxy Schema

		Operation Types:
			Roll-Up:	The consolidation of Data through the reduction of Dimensions / climbing up the Concept Hierarchy.
			Drilldown:	The refinement of Data through the increment of Dimensions / climbing down the Concept Hierarchy.
			Slice and Dice: 
				Slice: 	Extract Data Sets from the OLAP Cube.
				Dice:	Viewing the Data Sets from different Dimensions.
			Pivot: Rotate.
