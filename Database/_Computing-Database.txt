Database
	Abbreviations: 
		DBMS:					DataBase Management System.

		CMDB: 					Configuration Management Database.

	Description: 
		A Database is an Organized, Long-Term Collection of Data, generally Stored, Managed and Accessed via some System.
	
	Resources:
	
	Concepts:
		Data Types:
			Structured Data:	Data whose Elements are Directly Addressible (i.e. Tabular or Array-like Data).
			Semi-Structured Data: Data whose Elements may not be Directly Addressible, but still contain other forms of Organizational Properties (i.e. Tagged Data: XML).
			Unstructured Data:	Data which is currently observed to have no immediately helpful Pre-Defined Format (i.e. Binary Data: PDFs).

		Attribute / Key / Field: Refers to a characteristic of some type of Entity.
		Record:					A collection of Attributes pertaining to some instance of an Entity.
		Group:					A collection of Records.

		Index: 					An additional sparse Data Structure accompanying a Group that maps between a defined subset of each Record's Data, and Virtual Addresses of the Full Records on Disk.
			The optimization is more effective when Records are large => Less Records per Disk Partition => More Disk Accesses without an Index, which are Expensive.

		In-Memory Database: 	A Database which stores Data in Main Memory, which is much faster than Disk Storage as I/O is skipped. Suitable for Operations in which Response Time is critical.

		Database Types:
			Relational Database:
				Pros:
					ACID-strengthened Transactions:
						Atomicity:		Transactions containing multiple Statements will either succeed as a whole, or not be processed at all.
						Consistency:	Transactions can only bring the Database from one valid State to another, respecting Constraints, Cascades and Triggers within affected Data.
						Isolation: 		Transactions executed concurrently will behave the same if the Transactions are executed sequentially.
						Durability:		Transactions that have been commited will remain commited, even during System Failure (Power Outage / Crash).

				Cons:
					Does not Scale well:
						CAP Theorem suggests that Availability, Consistency and Partition Tolerance cannot be satisfied at the same time.
						Row-Based Data Structure not optimal for Data Compression.

					NewSQL:		Seeks to combine the strengths of Relational Databases with the strengths of Document Databases.

				Examples:
					PrestoDB:	Facebook's Distributed SQL Query Engine.

			NoSQL: Anything that is not storing Data in a Structured Table Format:
				Document Database:
					Pros:
						Scalability:
							Queries are handled as fast as possible.
							Easier to Scale Horizontally without ACID Considerations.

					Cons:
						No ACID-based Reliability as a result of Speed and Simplicity.

					Examples:
						Redis: In-Memory based Database with Disk Persistence that is often used as a Caching Layer on top of other RDBMSes.

			Data Warehouse

		Database Partitioning:
			Horizontal Partitioning: Different Records into Separate Groups (e.g. Sharding).
			Vertical Partitioning: Different Record Attributes into Separate Groups (e.g. Normalization or simple Record Splitting).
