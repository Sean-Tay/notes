Database
	Abbreviations: 
		DBMS:					DataBase Management System.

		CMDB: 					Configuration Management Database.

	Description: 
		A Database is an Organized, Long-Term Collection of Data, generally Stored, Managed and Accessed via some System.

	Concepts:
		Data Types:
			Structured Data:	Data whose Elements are Directly Addressible (i.e. Tabular or Array-like Data).
			Semi-Structured Data: Data whose Elements may not be Directly Addressible, but still contain other forms of Organizational Properties (i.e. Tagged Data: XML).
			Unstructured Data:	Data which is currently observed to have no immediately helpful Pre-Defined Format (i.e. Binary Data: PDFs).

		Attribute / Key / Field: Refers to a characteristic of some type of Entity.
		Record:					A collection of Attributes pertaining to some instance of an Entity.
		Group:					A collection of Records.

		Index: 					An additional sparse Data Structure accompanying a Group that maps between a defined subset of each Record's Data, and Virtual Addresses of the Full Records on Disk.
			The optimization is more effective when Records are large => Less Records per Disk Partition => More Disk Accesses without an Index, which are Expensive.

		Database Types:
			Relational Database
			Document Database
			Graph Database
			Key-Value Database
			In-Memory Database
			Data Warehouse

		Database Partitioning:
			Horizontal Partitioning: Different Records into Separate Groups (e.g. Sharding).
			Vertical Partitioning: Different Record Attributes into Separate Groups (e.g. Normalization or simple Record Splitting).
