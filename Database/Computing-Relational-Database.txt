	Abbreviations:
		ACID:				Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.

		DDL:				Data Definition Language.
		DML:				Data Manipulation Language.
		DCL:				Data Control Language.
		DQL:				Data Query Language.
		TCL:				Transactional Control Language.

		DBMS:				DataBase Management System.
		RDBMS:				Relational DataBase Management System.

		OLTP: 				OnLine Transaction Processing.
	
	Description:
		A Database that focuses on the efficient storage and retrival of Relational Data from Disk.
	
	Resources:

	
	Concepts:
		Attribute:			A property of a Record / Table that can hold a value to meaningfully represent information about what the Record is supposed to represent.

		Key: 				An Attribute of a Record in the Table.
		Unique Key: 		An Attribute / Attributes whose values can uniquely represent any Record in the Table.

		Record: 			Collection of related values pertaining to some Attributes.

		View:				Collection of Records resulting from the processing of some Query ; Result-Set.

		Table: 				Collection of Records with the same defined Attributes.

		Sharding: 			Splitting a Table by Rows.
		Normalization: 		Splitting a Table by Columns.

		Index: 				An additional sparse Data Structure accompanying a Table that maps between data from specified Table Attribute(s) and virtual addresses of the actual Table Records on disk.

		Database: 			Collection of Tables.
		
		Transaction:		A Unit of Work done / Measure of Change performed within a DBMS.
		ACID:				A set of desirable properties to apply to a Transaction when interacting with a Database.

		DDL:				Linguistic Mechanism for Defining (Create or Modify) the Data *Structures* within a Database.
		DML:				Linguistic Mechanism for Manipulating (Modify, Delete, Insert and Update) Data within a Database.
		DCL:				Linguistic Mechanism for Controlling (Grant or Revoke) access to the Data within a Database.
		DQL: 				Linguistic Mechanism for Querying (Selecting) Data wihtin a Database.
		TCL:				Linguistic Mechanism for Managing (Commit or Rollback) Transactions for a Database.

		Coherence:			Synchronization of shared Data at multiple locations.

		OLTP:				An approach to quickly serve Transaction Oriented Implementations (i.e. Sales Systems, ATM).
	
	Details:
		Data Structure:
			Entity: 		A Table whose Records represent one subject type.
			Relation: 		A Table whose Records track a type of connection between two or more Entities.

		ACID:
			Atomicity:		Transactions containing multiple Statements will either succeed as a whole, or not be processed at all.
			Consistency:	Transactions can only bring the Database from one valid State to another, respecting Constraints, Cascades and Triggers within affected Data.
			Isolation: 		Transactions executed concurrently will behave the same if the Transactions are executed sequentially.
			Durability:		Transactions that have been commited will remain commited, even during System Failure (Power Outage / Crash).

		OLTP:
			OLTP Applications have high throughput on Write Operations, and usually serves many Users at once.
				The Data Structure supporting these Applications must therefore be able to process Write Operations as quickly as possible.

				The Database Tables are hence highly Normalized for the sake of efficient Transaction Processing.
					The Normalized Nature of the Data reduces Data Redundancy, resulting in faster Insertions and Deletions.
					However, Database and Table Joins are more complex as a result, reducing Query Speed.
					Nevertheless, the Transactional Data recorded is available in Real-Time as a result of the fast Write Operations.
