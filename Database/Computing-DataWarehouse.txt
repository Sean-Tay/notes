Data Warehouse
	Abbreviations:
		DBMS:				DataBase Management System.
		RDBMS:				Relational DataBase Management System.

		OLAP: 				OnLine Analytics Processing.
	
	Description:
		A Database which is specifically designed to allow for efficient Analysis of Data.
	
	Tutorials:
		OLAP:				https://www.guru99.com/data-warehousing.html
	
	Concepts:
		OLAP: 				An approach to quickly serve Analytics Oriented Implementations (i.e. Business Intelligence Applications).
		OLAP Hypercube:		Refers to the Multi-Dimensional 'Cube Structure' of the Data involved in OLAP.
	
	Details:
		OLAP:
			Data Warehouses, the Databases that support OLAP, focus more on complex, Multi-Dimensional Queries, in a smaller volume.
				Usually involves archived / historical Data, which is why OLAP is optimized for purely Read Operations.
				This approach uses the Dimensional Model for superior Analytical Capability.

		OLAP Cube:
			Table Types:
				Fact Table: A collection of Facts and corresponding Measurements about the Managed Entity or System, and references to related Dimension Tables.
				Dimension Table: A companion to the Fact Table which contains textual or numerical Attributes that aid in Query Filtering or Query Result-Set Labelling. Dimensions describe the 'Who', 'What', 'When' or 'Where' of a Fact, whilst Attributes pertain to each Dimension's characteristics.

			Schema Types:
				Star Schema
				Snowflake Schema
				Galaxy Schema

		Operation Types:
			Roll-Up:	The consolidation of Data in one or more Dimensions.
			Drilldown:	To concentrate on smaller details within the Data.
			Slice and Dice: 
				Slice: 	Extract Data Sets from the OLAP Cube.
				Dice:	Viewing the Data Sets from different Dimensions.
