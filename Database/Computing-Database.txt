	Concepts:
		Transaction:		A Unit of Work done / Measure of Change performed within a Database Management System.
		ACID:				A set of desirable properties to apply to a Transaction when interacting with a Database.

		Index:				A sorted, sparse Data Structure that maps selected pieces of Data to storage locations on Disk, with the aim of improving lookup speed for Range Queries.
		
		DDL:				Linguistic Mechanism for Defining (create or modify) the Data *Structures* within a Database.
		DML:				Linguistic Mechanism for Manipulating (modify, delete, insert and update) Data within a Database.
		DCL:				Linguistic Mechanism for Controlling (grant or revoke) access to the Data within a Database.
		DQL: 				Linguistic Mechanism for Querying (selecting) Data wihtin a Database.
		TCL:				Linguistic Mechanism for Managing (commit or rollback) Transactions for a Database.

		Coherence:			Synchronization of shared data at multiple locations.
	
	Details:
		ACID:
			Atomicity:		Transactions containing multiple Statements will either succeed as a whole, or not be processed at all.
			Consistency:	Transactions can only bring the Database from one valid State to another, respecting Constraints, Cascades and Triggers within affected Data.
			Isolation: 		Transactions executed concurrently will behave the same if the Transactions are executed sequentially.
			Durability:		Transactions that have been commited will remain commited, even during System Failure (Power Outage / Crash).
