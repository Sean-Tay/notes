Azure
	Abbreviations:
		TCO:				Total Cost of Ownership.

		AD:					Active Directory.
		ARM:				Azure Resource Manager.

		SAS:				Shared Access Signature.
	
	Description:
	
	Resources:
	
	Concepts:
		TCO Calculator: 	Compare the cost of hosting your Service / System in Azure vs. On-Prem.
		Pricing Calculator: Estimate the cost of using various Azure Resources with different features / levels of Azure support.
		Azure Advisor:		Utility to assist in detecting underutilized Resources and ways to optimize Services, in Real-Time.
		Microsoft Cost Management: Quickly check Azure Resource costs, create Alerts based on Resource spend, and create Budgets that can be used to automate Resource Management.
			Cost Analysis:	View current and projected forecast on Azure Resource costs.

			Cost Alerts:	View all existing Alerts that can show up on Microsoft Cost Management. Alerts are also sent via email in some cases.
				Budget Alerts: Triggered when either pre-defined Cost or Usage Thresholds are exceeded.
				Credit Alerts: Triggered when 90% or 100% of an Enterprise's Azure Credit Balance is used.
				Department Spending Quota Alerts: Triggered when Department Spending reaches a fixed threshold of the Quota.

			Budgets: 		Set a spending limit for Azure Resources, based on a Subscription, Resource Group, Service Type, etc. A Budget Alert is also created as part of creating a Budget. Optionally, Budgets can be tweaked to automatically suspend or modify Azure Resources when the Budget is reached.

		Availability Zone: 	Contains one or more Azure Data Centers.
			Zone-Redundant Deployments: Azure Resources are replicated / distributed between Availability Zones automatically, for higher fault tolerance.
			Zonal Deployments: Azure Resources are kept within a single Availability Zone for more stringent latency / performance requirements.
		Azure Region:		Consists of one or more Availability Zones, each connected to another by high capacity, fault-tolerant, low latency Network Connections.

		Azure Arc:			Utility to help Organizations manage their Cloud Environment. Supports several Cloud Deployment Models.

		Management Groups:	A logical container to contain multiple Azure Subscriptions.
		Resource Group:		A logical container to contain Azure Resources.

		Serivce Principal:	Azure AD account whose metadata (i.e. Client ID, Secret) is managed by Users and not Azure. This Account can be used anywhere outside of Azure.
		Managed Identity:	A special type of Service Principal where Azure manages the metadata as well. This Account can only be used by other Azure-managed services.
			System Assigned: Each SAMI is attached to one Azure Resource (i.e. lifetime of the Azure Resource).
			User Assigned: 	Independent lifecycle, can be shared across Azure Resources.

		Azure VMWare:		IaaS-scoped Cloud VM Solution.
			Availability Set: Spreads groups of Azure VMs amongst Physical Hardware in different Fault and Update Domains, within one Location.
				Fault Domain: VMs within the same Fault Domain share Storage, Network, and Power, similar to a Server Rack in a Data-Center.
				Update Domain: VMs within the same Update Domain can be rebooted at the same time. Only one Update Domain within an Availability Set is rebooted at a time, ensuring continued operation of the Availability Set during planned maintenance.

		Azure VMware Solution: Migrate or extend existing VMware environments provided by other Cloud Providers to Azure.
			Azure Containers: Virtual Disk Solution for Azure VMWare.

			Azure Auto-Scale: Horizontal Scaling (w.r.t VMs) for hosted Applications running on VMs.
		Azure Monitor:		Offers services to gain insights on VM's performance and operational health.

		Azure Event Hub:	Analogous to Kafka Event Queues, these expose an Event 'Pull' Model for Consumers.
			Requests:		Number of API Requests made.
			Messages:		Number of API Requests that put actual Events into the Event Hub.

		Azure Event Grid:	Router for generated Events; usually to 'Push' Events from their Source to an Event Hub or a Webhook. Note: Has to be in the same Resource Group as the Event Source.
			System Topic: 	Designation for Events produced by other Azure Services.

		Azure Blob Storage:	Provides persistent Data Storage capability.
			Storage Account: Contains one or more Storage Containers. In the Kotlin SDK, this is referenced via BlobServiceClientBuilder.
			Storage Container: Contains one or more Blob Files. In the Kotlin SDK, this is referenced via BlobContainerClientBuilder, whilst individual Blobs are referenced via BlobClientBuilder.
				Block Blob:	A collection of one or more data Blocks. Default Blob Type.
				Page Blob: 	A collection of 512-Byte Pages optimized for random read and write operations.
				Append Blob: Similar to a Block Blob, except Blocks can only be appended to the Blob. Each Block is also much smaller than the Blocks in a Block Blob.
		Azure Files:		Provides synchronization between On-Prem Storage and Blob Storage.

		ARM Template:		Specifies configuration of specific Azure Resources.
	
	Details:
		Azure Well-Architected Framework: 
			For a given System, it should:
				Be Resilient, Available, and Recoverable.
				Be as Secure as needed.
				Support responsible development and operations.
				Accomplish its purpose within acceptable timeframes.
				Deliver a sufficient return on investment.

		Cost of Azure Services:
			Tools:
				TCO Calculator
				Pricing Calculator
				Azure Advisor
				Spending Limits: Specify thresholds to avoid OpEx overruns.

			Factors:
				Resource Type
				Consumption: Pay-as-you-go or Reserved "Contract" Pricing.
				Maintenance
				Geography: Cost of Labor, Power, Taxes vary per Region.
				Network Traffic: Inbound Data Transfers to Azure Datacenters are free, whereas Outbound Data Transfers from Azure Datacenters are priced based on Billing Zones.
				Subscription Type
				Azure Marketplace: Allows purchasing of Azure-based Solutions and Services from Third-Party Vendors - additional costs incurred from leveraging on the Third Party's skills and expertise for their Solution.

				Licensing
