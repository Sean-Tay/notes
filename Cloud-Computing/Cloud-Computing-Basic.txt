	Abbreviations:
		IaaS:					Infrastructure as a Service
		PaaS:					Platform as a Service
		SaaS:					Software as a Service

		MLaaS:					Machine Learning as a Service
		DBaaS:					Database as a Service
		FaaS:					Functions as a Service

	Description: 				The delivery of Compute Resources and Services over the Internet to offer faster innovation, flexible resources and economies of scale.
	
	Concepts:
		Traditional Computing: 	On-Premise Computing. Consists of Computer Hardware, Operating System, and Applications.
		
		Pillars of Cloud Computing:
			Virtualization:		Decoupling of a Logical Server from a Physical Server.
			Hypervisor:			Allows multiple OS-es to share the same Host, and manage the resource allocation to virtual OS-es.

		Cloud Service Models:
			IaaS: Virtual Hardware that replaces On-Premise Compute Resources. Example: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud.
				Compute:		Provides Computing Resources on demand.
				Block Storage: 	Provides Blocks for storing data.
				Network:		Provides Networking Capabilities.

			PaaS / Cloudware: Adds features to IaaS. Includes Operating Systems, Software Development Tools and Runtime Services. Example: RedHat Openshift.
				Object Storage:	Provides resources for how Objects are stored.
				Identity:		Provides a Layer for dealing with User Authentication.
				Runtime:		Provides a Runtime Environment for Applications to run on.
					Provisioning and Deployment Capabilities
					Load Balancing and Autoscaling
				
				Queue:			Used for Batch and Message Processing.

			SaaS: Software Licensing and Delivery Model. Applications are subscribed to on a monthly or yearly basis, and accessed over the Internet. Example: GitLab, Netflix.
		
		Cloud Deployment Models:
			Public Cloud:		Whatever the Client wants, the Client gets.
			Private Cloud:		On-Premise Cloud, achieved via Virtualization Software.
			Hybrid Cloud:		Combines Public and Private Cloud.
			Community Cloud:	Organizations with common interests.

		Shared Responsibility Model: Both the Cloud Provider and the Application are responsible for the integrity of the Application.

	Details:
		Intro:
			Disadvantage of Traditional Computing: Pace of keeping up with innovation becomes overwhelming.
				High Costs of maintaining and acquiring Compute Resources.
					Every few years Computer Hardware, Operating System and Applications become obsolete, and requires upgrading.
		
			Advantage of Cloud Computing:
				Lower Upfront Costs.
					Rent Computing Resources only when they are used.
					Reduced IT Staff and Admin costs.

				Enterprise-level Data Protection.

		Characteristics of Cloud Computing:
			Resource Pooling: All Resources provided by the Cloud Provider are seen as one large pool, to be divided amongst all Clients using them.
			Rapid Elasticity: Fast Allocation of Resources as Client's needs change.
				Scalability

			Self-Service: Automatically access any Resource at any time.
				Availability
		
		Shared Responsibility Model:
			Application:
				Configuration of the OS, Network and Firewall.
				Securing and Maintaining its own Data.
				Controlling how the Cloud Provider's Resources are used.
				
			Cloud Provider:
				Compute Resources
					Storage
					Network
			
				Availability
					Regions
					Edge Locations
