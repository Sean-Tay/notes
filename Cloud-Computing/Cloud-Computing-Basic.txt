Cloud Computing:
	Abbreviations:
		IaaS:					Infrastructure as a Service
		PaaS:					Platform as a Service
		SaaS:					Software as a Service

		MLaaS:					Machine Learning as a Service
		DBaaS:					Database as a Service
		FaaS:					Functions as a Service

		BPaaS:					Business Processes as a Service
		CaaS:					Communication as a Service
	
	Description: 				The delivery of Compute Resources and Services over the Internet to offer faster innovation, flexible resources and economies of scale.
	
	Concepts:
		Traditional Computing: 	On-Premise Computing. Consists of Computer Hardware, Operating System, and Applications.
		
		Pillars of Cloud Computing:
			Virtualization:		Decoupling of a Logical Server from a Physical Server.
			Hypervisor:			Allows multiple OS-es to share the same Host, and manage the resource allocation to virtual OS-es.

		Cloud Service Models:
			IaaS: Virtual Hardware that replaces On-Premise Compute Resources. Example: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud.
				Compute:		Provides Computing Resources on demand.
				Block Storage: 	Provides Blocks for storing data.
				Network:		Provides Networking Capabilities.

			PaaS / Cloudware: Adds features to IaaS. Includes Operating Systems, Software Development Tools and Runtime Services. Example: RedHat Openshift.
				Object Storage:	Provides resources for how Objects are stored.
				Identity:		Provides a Layer for dealing with User Authentication.
				Runtime:		Provides a Runtime Environment for Applications to run on.
					Provisioning and Deployment Capabilities
					Load Balancing and Autoscaling
				
				Queue:			Used for Batch and Message Processing.

			SaaS: Software Licensing and Delivery Model. Applications are subscribed to on a monthly or yearly basis, and accessed over the Internet. Example: GitLab, Netflix.
		
		Shared Responsibility Model: Both the Cloud Provider and the Application are responsible for the integrity of the Application. IaaS puts more responsibility on the Consumer, whilst SaaS shifts the responsibility to the Cloud Provider. PaaS is a middle ground.

		Cloud Deployment Models:
			Public Cloud:		Built, controlled and maintained by a Third-Party Cloud Provider - anyone who wants to purchase Cloud Services and Resources can use them.
			Private Cloud:		Cloud reserved for use by a single Entity, typically hosted on an dedicated Datacenter for the Company, and managed by the Company's IT Department.
			Hybrid Cloud:		Combines Public and Private Cloud for certain use-cases (e.g. quick scaling via Public Cloud to meet a temporary surge in demand).
			Community Cloud:	Organizations with common interests.
			Multi-Cloud:		A Cloud which combines features from several Cloud Providers.

	Details:
		Intro:
			Disadvantage of Traditional Computing: Pace of keeping up with innovation becomes overwhelming.
				High Costs of maintaining and acquiring Compute Resources.
					Every few years Computer Hardware, Operating System and Applications become obsolete, and requires upgrading.
		
			Advantage of Cloud Computing:
				Lower Upfront Costs.
					Rent Computing Resources only when they are used.
					Reduced IT Staff and Admin costs.

				Enterprise-level Data Protection.

		Characteristics of Cloud Computing:
			Resource Pooling: All Resources provided by the Cloud Provider are seen as one large pool, to be divided amongst all Clients using them.
			Rapid Elasticity: Fast Allocation of Resources as Client's needs change.
				Scalability

			Self-Service: Automatically access any Resource at any time.
				Availability
		
		Shared Responsibility Model:
			Application:
				Securing and Maintaining its own Data.
				Controlling how the Cloud Provider's Resources are used.
				Accounts and Identities of the People, Devices and Services within your organization.
			
			Application / Cloud Provider: Depending on Service Model (i.e. IaaS / PaaS / SaaS)
				Operating System
				Network Controls
				Applications
				Identity
				Infrastructure

			Cloud Provider:
				Compute Resources
					Physical Storage
					Physical Network
					Physical Hosts
			
				Availability
					Regions
					Edge Locations

		Accessing Cloud Resources:
			Through a Web Browser and a Web Protocol, such as HTTPS
			RDP - Remote Desktop Protocol for connecting to Virtual Windows Instances
			SSH - RDP equivalent for connecting to Virtual Linux Instances
			VPN - A Private Connection over a Public Network
			Direct Connect - A Physical Connection to the Cloud Provider's Network
