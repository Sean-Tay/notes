Git:
	Abbreviations:
		VCS						- Version Control System.
	
	Description:	
		Decentralized VCS.
			Larger Local Copy - Repo History saved.
			Does not need to be connected to Repo before Commits are made.
	
	Tutorial Videos / Playlist:
	
	Concepts: 
		origin					- A Local Alias for the Remote Repository's URL in interest.

		HEAD					- A Local Alias for the current Commit.
		
		Downstream				- Information Flow from Remote Repo to Local Repo.
		Upstream				- Information Flow from Local Repo to Remote Repo.
	
	Details:
	
	Commands:
		git config				- Configure Git.
			--global http."https://code.example.com/".sslVerify false - Disable SSL Cert Check for "code.example.com" domain.

		git init <directory>	- Create a Local Repository in the current *empty* Local Directory.
		git clone <repo_url>	- Copies a Remote Repository into the current *empty* Local Directory; creates Local Branches that track each available Remote Branch, before checking out the Local Branch that tracks the active Remote Branch of the Remote Repository.
			-o <repo_url_alias> - Specify a custom Local Alias to reference the Remote Repository URL (default is origin).

		git remote add <repo_url_alias> <username>@<server>:<repo_path_on_server> - Add a Local Alias for a Remote Repository URL.
		git remote -v			- View all Local Aliases within the current Repo.
		git remote remove <repo_url_alias> - Remove a Local Alias for a Remote Repository URL.

		git fetch				- Preview updates for all Local Branches tracking Remote Branches.
			FETCH_HEAD			- Creates a short-lived reference that keeps track of what has just been fetched from the Remote Repository. 

		git branch <branch> 	- Create a new Local Branch.
			-r					- List Remote Branches
			-a 					- List both Local and Remote Branches.

			-d <branch> 		- Delete a Local Branch.

			-u <repo_url_alias>/<remote-branch> <branch> - Set which Remote Branch the Local Branch pushes to.

		git checkout <branch> - Switches Local Branches.
			-B <new_branch>	- Creates a new Local Branch called <new_branch> based on the current Local Working Copy if it doesn't already exist, or resets it if it does already exist, and switches over to it.
				--track <repo_url_alias> <branch> - Forces <new_branch> to track a specified Remote Branch.

		git push -u <repo_url_alias> <branch> - Add the currently checked out Local Branch (with changes) to the Remote Repository.
		git push -d <repo_url_alias> <branch> - Remove a Branch on the Remote Repository.

		git checkout <commit> -- <file> ... - Switch current version of <file> with the <commit> version of <file>.

		git merge [<repo_url_alias>] <branch> - Merge updates from the Branch <branch> into the currently checked out Local Branch.
			--abort				- If Merge Conflicts will occur, this will revert the Merge. If there are prior Local Working Copy changes, those will be lost.
			--continue			- If Merge Conflicts will occur, this will allow for retrying the Merge after the edits are made. 

			--no-commit			- Prevent the automatic Commit behaviour of the Merge operation, allowing for edits to be made before actually making the Commit.
			
			--squash			- Combine all updates from the Branch <branch> into one, and add that combined update as one Commit into the currently checked out Local Branch. Does not actually merge <branch>, which helps keep git history of the currently checked out Branch clean.

		git cherry-pick <commit> - Selectively bring in a Commit from another Branch to the currently checked out Local Branch.
			--no-commit			- Apply the changes only to the Local Working Copy without Commiting.

		git pull [<repo_url_alias>] <branch> - git fetch + git merge.
			--allow-unrelated-histories - Merges two Repos that started independently.

		git status				- Get status of added, modified and removed <file>s in the current Local Branch.

		git diff [HEAD] <file> <file> - See differences between checked out <file> and Local Working Copy <file>.

		git add	<file> ...		- Specify changed <file>s to be added into the Local Staging List.
			-A 					- Specify that all new, modified or deleted files be added.
			--ignore-removal 	- Specify that only new or modified files be added.
			-u 					- Specify that only modified or deleted files be added.

			.					- <file> specification to add all new, modified or deleted files.

		git checkout -- . 		- Reset all files not in the Local Staging List in the current Directory.

		git reset -- <file> ... - Specify <file>s to be removed from the Local Staging List.
			--hard				- Reset all uncommited Local Changes to files.

		git checkout HEAD -- . 	- Reset all Local Changes to files in the current Directory.

		git stash <option> -- <file> - Save Local Working Copy Changes.
			stash@{<index>}		- Naming Convention of Stashes, with <index> 0 being the latest.

			push -m "<stash_message>" - Option to additionally revert back Local Working Copy to HEAD ; push as in push and pop.

			list 				- Option to view all Stashes.

			show stash@{<index>} - Option to show differences between Stash contents and Commit contents for which the Stash was created.
			pop stash@{<index>}	- Option to apply Stash onto current Local Working Copy, and to delete the Stash ; pop as in push and pop.
			branch <branch> stash@{<index>} - Pop the Stash onto a Local Branch rooted at the Commit at which the Stash was created.

			drop stash@{<index>} - Option to delete a specified Stash.
			clear				- Option to delete all Stashes.

		git commit -m "<commit_message>" - Commit the changes of the <file>s in the Local Staging List to the Local Branch.
			-a 					- Automatically stages all modified Files with the Commit.

		git commit --amend -m "<commit_message>" - Change the message of the most recent Commit. Note: Staged Changes will be included in this commit.

		git checkout -- <file> ... - Revert changes to <file>s.
		git reset HEAD~<number-of-commits> - Revert Local Branch by <number-of-commits>.

		git rebase <branch> 	- Reposition the base of the currently checked out Local Branch to the tip of the Local <branch>. 

		git push <repo_url_alias> <branch> - Push the changes of the checked out Local Branch to the specified Remote Branch.

		git tag 				- Mark an important Commit with a local reference.
			-a <tag> -m <tag_annotation> - Create an annotated local reference for the Commit.
			-d <tag>			- Delete a specified local reference.

		git push <repo_url_alias> <tag>	- Push the created Tag to the Remote Repository.
		git push <repo_url_alias> :/refs/tags/<tag> - Push the locally changed Tag to the Remote Repository.
		git push <repo_url_alias> -- tags - Push all locally changed Tags to the Remote Repository.
