DevOps and BizOps:
	Abbreviations:
		IT: Information Technology
		
		SME: Small-Medium Enterprises
		
		SDLC: Systems Developmnet Life Cycle / Application Development Life Cycle
		
		CX: Customer Experience
		UX: User Experience
	
	Description:
		DevOps is a combination of the Cultural Philosophies, Practices and Tools that increases an Organization's ability to deliver Applications and Services at a high-velociy to better serve their Customers and compete more effectively in the Market.
		BizOps is the same as the above, but on processes not directly in the realm of DevOps.
	
	Concepts:
		SDLC: The process of Analyzing the Use-Case of, Designing, Building, Testing, Releasing and Maintaining Software.
		
		Lean (Methodology): A method for removing the Baggage within a System without sacrificing Productivity. 
		
		Shared Services: Involves Servive Providers that serve multiple different Business Scopes.
		Dedicated Services: Involves Service Providers that solely serve a single Business Scope.
		
		Value Stream Mapping: A Tool to visualize the steps needed from Product Implementation to End-Customer Arrival (SDLC?), with the end goal of identifying bottlenecks in the Value Stream.
	
	Details:
		DevOps: 
			- To identify and eliminate unnecessary Organizational Complexity in the hopes of shortening the SDLC.
			
			- 2 Teams:
				- Dev: CX / UX Architects, Software Developers, Continuous Delivery Architects, Security Engineers, Build Engineers, Testers, etc.
				- Ops: Database Administrators, Systems Engineers, Systems Administrators, Network Engineers, Security Professionals, Release Engineers, Operations Staff, etc.
			
			- 3 Perspectives:
				(Dev to User) Flow: Accelerate the delivery of work from Dev to Ops to Users.
				(User to Dev) Feedback: To Improve the Flow.
				Continuous Learning and Experimentation: A vector for Organizational Improvement and a High-Trust Culture.
		
		Considerations:
			- The Golden Circle:
				1. Why:
					- Large Companies need to be more 'Agile' in a competitive Market Space, or risk losing their customers to other Smaller Companies that are quicker and more efficient.
						- Startups / SMEs have less accrued Organizational Complexity: 
							- They can manuever to more quickly meet Customer Requirements.
							- No rigid processes -> more room for Innovation and Creative Solutions -> attraction point for Customers.
							
						- Startups / SMEs have smaller Manpower, less likely to have isolated Teams:
							- Encourages Collaboration:
								- No blame-game between Teams.
								- Everyone is commited into pushing things to Production, and not just up to their direct jurisdictions.
						
					- Is it right for the situation?
						- Why break something if it is already working?
							- Example: Is there enough Competition in the Market to warrant the time and effort into the 'leanification' of such processes?			
							
				2. How (is it different)?
					- Centralized (Traditional Shared Services) -> Decentralized (New Dedicated Services) Business Model: 
						- Accountability clearly defined through Hierarchical Structure -> Faster Decision Making due to flat Hierarchy
						- Easier Standardization and Compliance through Consistent Policies and Processes -> Higher Productivity with Leaner Policies
						- Less Cost through Economies of Scale -> Increased Specialism
						- Ideal for Mature Products -> Ideal for Rapidly Changing Products
						
						- A tradeoff between Agility and Stability.
					
					- Transition:
						- Shared Services for Everything -> Agile Business Teams (DevOps) + ( Lean Shared Services (BizOps) -> Highly Automated Shared Services + Lean Manual Processes that cannot be automated)
					
				3. What:
					- What is the End-Goal?
						- What is the ultimate benefit to the Business in doing such practices?
							- Common Benefits:
								- Savings in Time
								- Savings in Money
