	Details:
		Methodology:
			1. Clarify the Problem:
				Derivation of Concrete Details based on Estimation of Fuzzy Details:
					Requirements:
						Functional Requirements?
							What is the App / Service supposed to do, and Scope.
								Encryption of Data?

							Storage Requirements?
								Cloud Distributed File Storage for Blob-Like Information: Generates a URL to the Resource.

						Non-Functional Requirements?
							Availability?
								Uptime?
									90% -> 36.5 Days Offline per Year
									95% -> 18.25 Days Offline per Year
									99% -> 3.65 Days Offline Per Year
									99.9% -> 8.77 Hours Offline Per Year
									99.99% -> 1 Hour Offline Per Year

									Internal or External Usage?

								Redundancy?

								Server Health Monitoring?

							Scalability?
								Peak Usage Scenarios for provided Service?
									Per Second?
									Per Minute?
									Per Hour?

								Horizontal Scalability: How easy is it to add more Machines to each part of the System.
									Load Balancing: Something that helps to distribute Traffic to other multiple identical Web Servers.
										Server Software: Nginx
										DNS Load Balancing: A Technique which gives different IP Addresses of the different available Web Servers per Request.
											Hash the IP Address of the Request?

								Vertical Scalability: Improve the existing Machines by replacing sub-optimal Parts with better Performing ones.

							Available Budget of Compute Resources?
								Message Queue to prevent dropped Requests if Server is at Full Load?

								Read-Write I/O Frequency
									Database: 
										Master (Read / Write) - Slave (Read)?
											1 to 2 Seconds Delay, which may be okay depending on Data Consistency Requirements. If not, just immediately Read from the Master after the Write Operation.

										Improve Read Performance by using Indexes on certain Table Columns.
											Cons:
												Larger Disk Space Requirement.
												Slows down Write Operations.
													// If Index is on Primary Key only, it should not affect.

										In Memory Cache for even better performance?
											Application to handle Reading from DB and storing it in Cache if Cache does not have requested Information?

											Pre-Caching Service to compute Calculation Intensive Results -> Cache?

										Partitioning for Write-Heavy Database?

							Latency?
								Global CDN - for Static Asset Files.
									Saves Content to a Storage in a Local Area so that Users in that Area can all access from that Storage, which may be faster in terms of distance.

								Peer-to-Peer Distribution between Local Data Centers?

							Bandwidth? For Areas with Poor Internet Access?
								1 Byte - 1 Character
								Compression?

			2. Create API based on Functional Requirements:
				Application API Considerations:
					RESTful API / RPC
					CRUD API

				Database Design:
					a. Start with a Conceptual Data Model. This describes at a High Level the sorts of Data required, and how they relate to each other. For example, what sort of Entities are required.

					b. From the Conceptual Data Model, we can then start on the Logical Data Model. This involves Abstract Details like Tables, Columns, Primary Keys, but also further metadata that may be required of each Entity.
						Note: A good Logical Data Model does not depend on any one Database Implementation.
						Note: Any Relational Database can be used to implement the Design - the Design is free from Specific Implementation Details.

					c. Once the Logical Data Model is finished, Physical Data Models can be created from the Logical Data Model, each of which deals with some of the DBMS-specific Implementation Details.
							Example: Which Rows of the Table are stored in which Storage Device, Which Columns should be used as part of Indexes.
