	Description: A Lightweight Frontend Library for building User Interfaces for Applications. It is part of the View Layer in the MVC Architecture.
	
	Resources:
		Quick Start: https://youtu.be/sBws8MSXN7A
	
	Concepts:
		React Element:				Lightweight, Immutable, Stateless, Functionless, Nestable, plain JS Object that describes what should be shown on screen - a Virtual DOM Node or Sub-Tree. It is implicitly produced when inline JSX is compiled down to React.createElement() calls during Rendering.
		Virtual DOM: 				A Lightweight Reflection of the Actual DOM (i.e. CSS Layout recalculation, etc.), which can be seen as being represented by a Tree of React Elements.
		Actual DOM:					The state in the Browser that keeps track of exactly how the Webpage should display and behave.

		React Component:			Refers to the syntactical definition that would create a React Component Instance.
		React Component Instance:	An Instance of a React Component. Returns a React Element adjusted for State and Functions when Rendered.

		State:						Information maintained by a React Component Instance which it itself can change.
		Props: 						Information received by a React Component Instance from other React Component Instances which it should NOT change directly.

		Rendering: 					The process by which React determines how the UI should look and appear by checking involved React Component Instances.

		[Re-]Render: 				The process of [re-]creating any associated React Element from a React Component Instance. This often results in Reconciliation.
		Reconciliation:				The asynchronous process of diff-ing the current Virtual DOM Tree, and the next Virtual DOM Tree with changes from any Re-Renders applied to ascertain the actual changes needed for the UI / Actual DOM, and the minimum number of steps to do so. The changes are accumulated before the diff-ing occurs as a form of optimization.

		Mounting:					Phase in the Component Lifecycle in which a Component Instance is going to be Painted for the first time.
		Updating: 					Phase in the Component Lifecycle in which a Mounted Component Instance is updating due to changes in Props or State.
		Unmounting: 				Phase in the Component Lifecycle in which a Mounted Component Instance is being removed from the Actual DOM Tree. 

		Uncontrolled Component:		A React Component Instance that maintains its own internal State.
		Controlled Component:		A React Component Instance that does not maintain internal State.
	
	Details:
		React.js Library manages the Virtual DOM.
		ReactDOM.js Library handles the Reconciliation process, as well as updating the Actual DOM.

		React faciliates the construction of SPAs:
			The default entry point, public/index.html, contains a top-level <div> 'root', which will contain the entirety of the React Application as part of the SPA functionality.
			The default Javascript entry point, src/index.js, should reference a top-level React Component 'App' and render it in the top-level <div> 'root'.
				import React from 'react';
				import {render} from 'react-dom';
				
				import './index.css';
				import 'App' from './App.js';
				
				render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
		
		Rendering:
			During the Rendering Process, each Component will describe how the UI state should appear, given certain information that it has / receives (i.e. State / Props), usually via JSX.
				React Elements are produced when inline JSX is compiled down to React.createElement() calls during Rendering.
					Evaluation of any JS is only done via JS Injection within curly braces.
						You cannot inject JS if-statements directly within JSX. Utilize either:
							1. Ternary Operator - it always evaluates to a JS Expression (returns a value) unlike an if-else statement.
							2. Immediately-Invoked JS Function - (() => {})()
					Utilize the && operator for code that either will or will not appear. 
					JSX can still be used within the braces.
					Multi-line JSX should be enclosed with parentheses.
				
				React Elements can have attributes, akin to HTML DOM Elements.
					Note: Replace the 'class' DOM attribute to 'className' for compiling from JSX -> JS, since 'class' is a reserved keyword in JS.
					Note: CSS style DOM attribute to be specified as a JS Object, and with the names of usual CSS style properties in camelCase as opposed to kebab-case.
					Note: HTML DOM Event Listener attributes have their names specified in camelCase instead of lowercase.
					Note: Child Elements produced from mapping an Iterable need to have the top-level Child Element specify a distinguishing 'key' element.
						Iterable Indexes are not ideal keys, as they will not work correctly in letting React know what has changed during element order-sensitive operations.

				React Elements can be nested, akin to HTML DOM Elements.
					All React Elements must have only exactly one outermost React Element. The first opening tag and the final closing tag must belong to the same React element.

					Can use a <div> </div> or React Fragment (<> </>) to enclose the group.

			By default, a Component Instance gets [Re-]Rendered when:
				When the State of a Component Instance changes.
					Presumably, Props come from an Ancestor's State, and if the Ancestor's State changes, the Ancestor's Component Instance would be Re-Rendered, which by default should propagate the Re-Render call down to the current Component Instance.
						Tip: Be careful of derived State from Props - it is not obvious that the State won't update further as a result of a change in Props.
				
				Whenever an Ancestor Component Instance gets [Re-]Rendered.
		
		Best Practices:
			Rely only on a Single-Source of Truth for each variable. Go with either: 
				Controlled Child Component:
					Pass Parent Component State / State Changer Function into the Controlled Child Component as Props.

					Business Logic (Container Parent Component) and Display Logic (Presentational Child Component) are separated.

				Uncontrolled Child Component:
					Props for the Uncontrolled Child Component should only be used to derive its *initial* State.

					Using the special 'key' Prop would offer the Parent Component some way to reset the Uncontrolled Child Component.
					Expose a method in the Uncontrolled Child Component for the Parent Component to invoke (use a Ref to get a reference to the Child Component Instance).

			Keep the Render Functionality of a Component free from any resource-intensive operations, or long running side-effects.

		React Components:
			import * as React from 'react';

			Class-Component:
				import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
				
				import './ExampleClass.css';
				import 'OtherComponent' from './OtherComponent.js';

				import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

				// Note: Class Names to begin with a Capital Letter to help React distinguish between HTML Elements and React / JSX Element.

							this.handleStateChange = this.handleStateChange.bind(this);
						}

						// Set State without need for declaring Constructor.
						state = {
							// ...
						};

						// Pass Custom Function to Child Component to alert Component when Child Component receives an Event to change State.
						handleStateChange(callback) {
							// Don't modify this.state directly, otherwise React won't know to re-render the Component.
							// Use setState() instead to merge in changes to the State, which will also implicitly re-render the Component.
							// Don't reference this.state directly as the update triggered by this.setState is asynchronous - use the update function argument form, as shown below.
							this.setState(
								(state, props) => {
									return {
										// New Object that represents the intended changes to the State Object.
										// DO NOT mutate the State Object directly.
									};
								},
								callback

							// return null to not update the State.
						}

						// Compulsory
						render() {
							// Examines this.props and this.state, and returns a React Element.
							// Child Component Instances are also triggered to Render.
							// This should be a Pure Function - do not call this.setState() or mutate any State here.

					// Mounting:

						}

						}
				}
				
				// Explicit Declaration of expected types for Props helps to avoid errors.
				ExampleComponent.propTypes = {
					<prop-name>: PropTypes.<prop-type>[.isRequired],
					<onStateChange>: PropTypes.func[.isRequired], // parent.handleStateChange
					...
				};

				ExampleComponent.defaultProps = {
					<prop-name>: <default-value>,
					<onStateChange>: () => {},
					...
				}
				
				export default ExampleComponent;
				
				// ...

			Functional Component:
				// Useful as Presentational Components
				const ExampleComponent = (props) => { // Recall that all Properties defined via JSX gets put into a singular 'props' Object by React.
					// Extract / Consume the Props that are used.
					// other will contain all other unused Props via destructuring, which can then be separately passed down to Child Components.
					const {<used-prop>, // ... , ...other} = props;

					// other can also be referenced normally as a regular Object variable.
					// console.log(other);

					// ...
					
					return (
						{ // Ensure unknown, unconsumed Props are specified first - later Props will override if applicable }
						<ChildComponent {...other} usedProp={<used-prop>} ... /> 
					);
				}

				// React Hooks can be used to 'hook' onto Class Component Functionality:
				const ExampleComponent = (props) => {
					// Each Hook has the prefix 'use' in its name.
					// React counts on the Hook Definition Order - only define Hook Definitions at the Top-Level of the Function, outside of any Conditionals, Loops or other Functions.

					// Local Component State
						// Each State Variable defined in the manner below is independent from one another.
						// Note: Old State Values for each Variable will always be completely replaced when using the accompanying Setter Function. Keep in mind when updating Data Structures.
						// Note: The State Value does NOT get updated if it was initialized from a Prop and that Prop changes. Update it via useEffect.
						const [ <state-var>, <state-var-setter-function> ] = React.useState(<initial-value>);

						// Modify the State.
						<state-var-setter-function>(<new-value>);
						// Modify the State based on the previous State.
						<state-var-setter-function>(
							(<prev-value>) => {
								// ...
								return <new-value>;
							}
						);

						// To minimize the amount of times the State gets updated, do the following:
							1. Create a separate copy of the <state-var> to be changed at the start of the scope.
							2. Modify the copy as needed.
							3. Only call the <state-var-setter-function> once at the end of the scope with the modified copy.

					// Local Component State - No Re-Render
						// Changes made to these Variables here will not cause a Re-Render.
						// Tip: This can also be used to maintain references to non-primitive Variables across Renders.
						const <ref-var> = React.useRef(<initial-value>);
						// Access / Modify the Ref.
						<ref-var>.current = <new-value>;

					// Advanced Local Component State Management
						// The key difference between useState and useReducer is that for useReducer the State can be altered in a controlled manner as opposed to simply using the <state-var-setter-function>.
						// It is also more suited for managing State Objects that have multiple sub-values.
						const [ <state-var>, <dispatch-function> ] = React.useReducer( 
							(state, action) => {
								// Reducer Function - A Function that combines two or more Arguments and returns the combination.
								// Practically, it should be a Pure Function that:
									// Does not mutate Arguments.
									// Does not generate Side-Effects (API Calls, etc).
									// Execute Impure Functions within.

								// Based on action's Properties, a new State based on the passed in state should be returned.
									// Switch on action.type
									// action.payload
								return {
									...state,
									// ...
								};
							}, 
							<initial-state>
						);

					// Side-Effects
						// Similar Behaviour to componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate and componentWillUnmount combined - the submitted Function executes after each Render (when Props or State changes), without blocking the Browser from Painting the display.
						React.useEffect(
							() => {
								// ... 

								// Return an optional cleanup Function that is executed just before each subsequent Render.
								return () => {
									// ...
								};
							}, 
							// An optional 'Dependency List' of Variables can be specified as well to limit when the submitted Function executes.
							// By submitting this List of Variables, React will then additionally only execute the submitted Function if any of the Variables in the List are changed ( === type check ) after the first Render.
							// Tip: Passing an Empty List here would make the submitted Function behave like componentDidMount.
							// Tip: For Arrays and Objects, use JSON.stringify for a cheap deep comparison.
							// Note: For Functions, ES6 Sets and Maps, the default JSON.stringify does not work correctly on them. Stick to comparing their References.
							[ <variable>, ... ]
						);

						// Same functionality as with useEffect, except that it DOES block the Browser from Painting until the execution is over.
						React.useLayoutEffect(
							() => {
								// ...
							},
							[ <variable>, ... ]
						);

					// Optimizations - Avoid using as a guarantee to prevent Re-Renders.
						// Important Note: The Dependency Array for Optimization Hooks is of a different nature than the ones used for Side-Effect Hooks. If the submitted Function may directly or indirectly reference any Component's State (it's own or from Ancestor Components' passed in as Props), the references should be placed in the Dependency List.
						// Tip: For Arrays and Objects, use JSON.stringify for a cheap deep comparison.
						// Tip: For Functions, specify as it is (do NOT use JSON.stringify) to avoid false negatives.
						// Note: For Functions, ES6 Sets and Maps, the default JSON.stringify does not work correctly on them. Stick to comparing their References.

						// Used to prevent unneccessary recalculation of some value per Re-Render.
						// Tip: That 'some value' can be a React Element too. Note that if the wrapped Child Component internally Re-Renders, this method cannot stop it, as the corresponding render call does not occur within this, or an Ancestor, Component.
						// Tip: Consider using useRef for defining 'initial values', rather than useMemo.
						React.useMemo(
							() => {
								// ...

								return expensive(<variable>, ...);

								// OR 

								return <ExampleComponent arg={<variable>} />;
							},
							// Optional 'Dependency List' of Variables.
							[ <variable>,  ... ]

							// OR

							// Optional Comparator Function
							(prev, next) => {
								// return true if the value should not be recalculated
								// return false otherwise
							}
						);
						
						// Used to define Functions within Functional Components that won't be unneccessarily recreated per Re-Render.
						React.useCallback(
							(<arg-1>, ...) => {
								// ...

								return;
							}, 
							// Optional 'Dependency List' of Variables.
							[ <variable>, ... ]
						);

					// DOM Node Reference
					const nodeRef = React.useRef();
					// ... <div ref={{nodeRef}}> </div> ...
					// ... nodeRef.current ...

					// Flow:
						1. Define initial States via useState Hooks if necessary. Avoid deriving State from Props.
						2. Query backend API and update State with useEffect / custom Hooks, and with a Dependency List containing Props that pertain to the HTTP Request and REST Query Parameters.
						3. Render the actual Component only when a certain flag passed from the backend API changes. Use a placeholder 'Loading' Component if the flag is not of a certain state.

					// Tips:
						1. Define an external Pure Function to Deeply Clone the Initial State for a Component, so that the Shape of the Component's State is easy to see in one place.
							Single Source of Truth: In places where the State needs to be reset, this approach would prevent unwanted Code Duplication.
						
						2. Prefer useCallback for situations where setting Component State is involved, and external Pure Functions where it is not.
							For controlled execution of Callbacks after asynchronous setStates, utilize useEffect and special State flags, of which the Callbacks will trigger only when the State flag is true, and sets it back to false after execution is finished.

			Utilities:
				// React Context API:
					// Allows for any Descendant Component to access Data / Functionality specified / maintained at an Ancestor Component.
					// Use only if the Data / Functionality needs to be accessible at many different levels of the Component Tree.

					// Tip: In the spirit of Modularity, define all Context-related specification detailed below inside one File.

					// Create a Context.
					// Note: <default-xxx> is only used if there is no Ancestor Component that renders the corresponding Context.Provider.
					// Tip: Create two different Contexts each time - one for State Data, and another for Dispatch Functionality - this prevents the need to memoize an additional Object later on.
					const StateContext = React.createContext(<default-value>);
					const DispatchContext = React.createContext(<default-dispatcher>);

					// ...

					// Render Context.Provider in an Ancestor Component.
					// Useful for setting the <default-value> w.r.t some existing Component Instance (i.e. Running Applicaton) State.
					export const Provider = ({children}) => {
						// Can use useState or useReducer for each Context's value.
						const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer( // ... );

						// Tip: If only using one Context for both State and Dispatch, use Memoization to minimize re-renders in Descendant Components.
						const contextValue = React.useMemo(
						 	() => ({
								state,
								dispatch
							}),
							[ state, dispatch ]
						);

						return (
							<StateContext.Provider value={state}>
								<DispatchContext.Provider value={dispatch}>
									{children}
								</DispatchContext.Provider>
							</StateContext.Provider>
						);
					};

					// ...

					// Use the Contexts in Components.
						// Single Context:
							// Class Components
							class Consumer extends React.Component {
								static contextValue = Context;

								// ... this.contextValue
							}

							// Function Components
							export const Consumer = ({children}) => {
								return (
									<Context.Consumer>
										{
											value => children(value)
										}
									</Context.Consumer>
								);
							};

							// OR

							const Consumer = () => {
								const contextValue = React.useContext(Context);

								// ...
							};

						// State + Dispatch Contexts
							export const useContext = () => {
								const stateContext = React.useContext(StateContext);
								const dispatchContext = React.useContext(DispatchContext);

								if (stateContext === <defaultState> || dispatchContext === <defaultDispatch>) {
									// Possibly throw an Error here to force usage of the Provider Component.
									// throw new Error('Must be used within the corresponding Provider Component.');
								}

								return [stateContext, dispatchContext];
							};

				// Ref Forwarding:
					// Allows Users of the Component to specify ref in the same way that they would for a native HTML React Component.
					React.forwardRef(
						(prop, ref) => {
							// ...
						}
					);

				// Child Element Manipulation:
					// The 'children' Data Structure implicitly passed into every React Element is not the usual native JS Array.
					// Utilize the React.Children API Object to handle the 'children' Data Structure.

					// Array Methods:
					React.Children.<{ count | toArray }>(children);

					// Verify that this current Element only has one Child:
					React.Children.only(children);

					// Iteration:
					React.Children.<{ map | forEach }>(children, <iterative-function>);

					// Wrapping Children:
					// Utilize the React.cloneElement Function to recreate another React Element based off the children.
					React.Children.map(children, child => React.cloneElement(
						child,
						<additional-props-object>, // More props to apply to Child Element.
						<new-children> // Replaces existing Children of the Child Element.
					));

				// Error Boundaries:
					// Allows Component to define logic for Handling Errors encountered during Rendering Child Components.
						// Note: This means it won't catch:
							// 1. Errors thrown from Asynchronous Code w.r.t Rendering.
							// 2. Errors from Server-Side Rendering.
							// 3. Errors thrown in the Error Boundary itself, rather than its Children.

					// By default, any uncaught Errors will result in the Unmounting of the whole React Component Tree.

					// Note: Only implementable via Class Components.
						class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
							// ...

							// Called before the Render Phase of this Component (after the Render Phase of Child Components).
							// Note: Works with Server-Side Rendering.
							static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
								// Note: Side-Effects are not permitted here.

								// return an Object to update the State.
								// return null to not update the State.
							}

							// Called after the Render Phase.
							// Note: Does not work with Server-Side Rendering.
							componentDidCatch(error, info) {
								// Note: Should be used for Side Effects, rather than updating State, as this triggers after the Render Phase.

								// ...
							}

							// ...
						}

			Application Rendering:
				let ExampleComponentElement = React.createElement(ExampleComponent, propsObject, ... children);
				ReactDOM.render(ExampleComponentElement, document.getElementById('...')); // Actually mount to DOM.

				// OR

				ReactDOM.render(<ExampleComponent />, document.getElementById('...'));

				// OR 

				ReactDOM.render(<ExampleComponent> // ... </ExampleComponent>, document.getElementById('...'));
				// Within ExampleComponent, the special props.children can be used to reference all nested React Elements that is a child of this ExampleComponent.
				// React.Children API Methods.
		
		React Form: Modified HTML Form that uses React State as a single-source of truth.
			Typical HTML Form Elements maintain their own State (Uncontrolled). However, the React version of these Elements use the Component State instead (Controlled).
				This enforces that every State mutation will have an associated handler function, making it straightforward to modify or validate User Input.
				Allows for finer-grained synchronization between User Input and Component State.

			When these HTML Input Elements have a 'value' attribute specified in the React Element specification, they switch from using their internal State to the React Component State instead:
				<input value={this.state.value} onChange={this.onChangeHandlerFunction} />
