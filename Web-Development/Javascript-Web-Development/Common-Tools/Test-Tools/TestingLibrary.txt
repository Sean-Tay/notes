(DOM) Testing Library
	Abbreviations:
	
	Description: Allows for Testing of UI Components in a User-centric Way.
	
	Resources:
	
	Concepts:
		data-testid: 			Convention: Custom Element Property that allows for quick test-only lookups via queryById. Can be stripped away during Compilation via babel-plugin-react-remove-properties.
	
	Details:
		Packages:
			@testing-library/dom: Lightweight Solution for testing Web Pages by providing Utilities for querying and interacting with DOM Nodes.
				// screen: Interface for obtaining Nodes from the DOM State. Re-exported by the Wrapper Packages.
					// query* Functions will return the Element or null if it can't be found.
						// Tip: Use these only when asserting an Element's existence.

					// get* Functions will return the Element or throw an Error (with the full DOM Structure in readable format) if it can't be found.

					// findBy* Asynchronous Functions that will resolve with the Element or reject if the default timeout of 10000ms is exceeded.
						// Note: Useful to avoid the 'act' Error Output by waiting for a Component to finish loading when it calls an API on Mount.

			@testing-library/jest-dom: Provides custom Jest Matchers for testing DOM State.
				// expect( ... ).toBeInTheDocument(): Jest Matcher for checking if Elements are in the DOM State.
				// expect( ... ).toBeDisabled(): Jest Matcher to check if an Element is correctly disabled.

			@testing-library/user-event: Provides Utility Methods to simulate User Events.
				import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';

				userEvent.click(<dom-node>)
				userEvent.type(<dom-node>, <text>)

			@testing-library/react: Renders React Components into DOM Nodes.
				// render: Render a React Component onto the DOM State.
				// Tip: 'queries' have the same Methods as 'screen', except there is no need to specify the DOM Node to start the search from.
				// Tip: Already wrapped with 'act'.
					const queries = render(<element />, {
						// Specify a DOM Node to append the <element /> to.
						// Defaults to document.body.
						container: <dom-node>, // document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('<html-element-type>'))
					})

				// fireEvent: Alternative to @testing-library/user-event.
				// Tip: Already wrapped with 'act'.
				// Tip: Use @testing-library/user-event over this - the methods more closely resemble typical User Interactions than the ones in fireEvent.

				// act: Wrapper Function to wrap any Code that would trigger a State Update.
					act(() => { ... })
					await act(async () => { ... })

			@testing-library/react-hooks: Creates a simple Test Harness for React Hooks, avoiding the need to create unnecessary Function Components in tests.
				// The package will auto-detect which Renderer is available to use for the Test Harness.
				// If a Renderer is required, use more specific Import Paths:
					'@testing-library/react-hooks/dom'
					'@testing-library/react-hooks/native'
					'@testing-library/react-hooks/server'

				// Note: console.error gets mocked when importing from this library. This can affect Tests that rely on asserting an output from console.error.

				// renderHook: Render a Test Component that will call <custom-hook> each time it renders.
					const { result, waitFor, waitForNextUpdate } = renderHook(() => <custom-hook>( ... ))
						// Tip: Avoid destructuring the 'result' Object to prevent Closure-related Issues.

						// result.current: The current Return Value from <custom-hook>.
						// result.error: Any thrown Errors from the <custom-hook>.
						// result.all: An Array of all results from the Testing thus far.

					// Wait for Hook to trigger one re-Render.
					await waitForNextUpdate()

					// Wait for Hook to update a particular variable.
					await waitFor(() => result.current.<variable> === <value>)

				// cleanup: Unmounts all Rendered Hooks, ensuring all Effects have been flushed.
					// Tip: Automatically called if Testing Framework supports the afterEach global.
