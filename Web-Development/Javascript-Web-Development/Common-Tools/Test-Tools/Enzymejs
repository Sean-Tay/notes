	Details:
		Enzyme by itself cannot run Tests - it is simply a Utility to examine the internals of UI (mostly React) Components at a given time. A Test Runner (such as Jest) is needed as the Testing Framework.
			Note: React Enzyme internally uses react-test-renderer.

		Configuration: An adapter for the specific version of the Frontend Framework needs to be installed alongside the respective Enzyme Core Package.

		API:
			// shallow - Allows isolated testing of a Component, with the assurance that Child Components are not being tested at the same time.
				const wrapper = shallow(
					<rendered-component>, // React Element
					{	
						// To pass Context into the UI Node.
						context: <context>,
						
						// Specify a Parent Wrapping Component (which must render its Children).
						// Note: NOT the Component Instance / React Element (ignore the Arrow Brackets).
						wrappingComponent: <Component>,
						wrappingComponentProps: {
							// ...
						},
					}
				);

				// Commonly-Used API
					wrapper.find('<css-selector>');			Obtain all Wrapped Nodes in the Render Tree of the Wrapped Node that matches the specified <css-selector>.

					wrapper.contains(<rendered-sub-component>); Determines if the Render Tree of the Wrapped Node contains the <rendered-sub-component>, as well as the Children.
