	Description: Web Application Backend Routing / Middleware Framework.
	
	Resources:

	
	Concepts:
		Routing: Utilizes the HTTP Request Methods, as well as the Path section of the supplied URL in a received HTTP Request to determine what to do.
		
		HTTP Request Methods:
			Create / POST 
				Status Code: 
					Success - 201 Created
					Fail - 400 Bad Request
			Read / GET
				Status Code: 
					Success - 200 OK
					Fail - 404 Not Found
			Update / PUT
				Status Code: 
					Success - 200 OK
					Fail - 404 Not Found
			Delete / DELETE
				Status Code: 
					Success - 204 No Content
					Fail - 404 Not Found

			Note: PUT and POST interchangeable for Updating, but PUT is idempotent (i.e. calling PUT repeatedly will only update once), whereas POST is not (i.e. calling POST repeatedly will update repeatedly).

		Middleware: Code that executes on the Server between the time it receives a Request and sends a Response.
	
	Details:	
		const express = require(); // Import the Express Module.

		const app = express();	// Creates a new Express Server Instance.

		const router = express.Router(); // Express Routers are convenient in keeping Middleware and their associated code together in a modular manner.
		
		// In Express, Middleware can be attached to the Express Server Instance, or a Router.

		// In order for Middleware to match to a Request, the entirety of one of its assigned Route Paths must be matched.
		// The Middleware are called in the order that they are registered.
		<{app | router}>.<{HTTP Request Method | use}>(	 // Define new Middleware for this App / Router.
			// Specifies the Routes Paths to match. Optional.
			[
				"<route-path>",
				// ...
			],
			// Specify Middleware Functions:
			[ 				
				// If four arguments are defined, this Middleware Function is set to only handle Errors.										
				([err, ] req, res, next) => { 						
					req.params.<parameter>	// Accesses the <parameter> passed into the Routes (i.e. '/route/:<parameter>'). Note: <parameter> is a string.
					req.query.<key>	// Accesses the <value> assigned to the <key> passed into the Routes (i.e. '/route/?<key>=<value> & ...'). Note: <value> is a string.

					// Add Event Handlers when Events occur for the Request Object.
					req.on('event-type', () => {					
						// ...
					});

					// Tip: Also possible to attach Objects to pass into the next Function / Middleware via the Request Object.
					
					// Include 'return' to break from the Middleware.

					[return] res.[status(<http-status-code>].end(); // Finalize the Response Body with no Data, whilst setting an optional <http-status-code>.

					[return] res.[status(<http-status-code>].send(<data>); // Include <data> in the Response Body, whilst setting an optional <http-status-code>.
						// Useful to return Created / Updated / Deleted Object back to the Client for synchronization purposes.

					[return] res.[status(<http-status-code>].json(<json-obj>); // Include <json-obj> in the Response Body, whilst setting the Content Type appropriately.

					[return] next(); // Execute the next Function defined in the encompassing List.
					[return] next('route');	// Skip to the next Middleware of the same HTTP Request Method with the same Route Path. Only usable for Middleware responding to specific HTTP Request Methods.
					
					[return] next(err); // Skip to the next Error-Handling Middleware. Express can automatically handle Synchronous Errors, but Asynchronous Errors require this Function Call.
				},
				//...
			]
		);
		
		// Mount a Router to the Express Server Instance.
		app.use(													
			"<route-path>",	 	// All Middleware attached to the Router will now be assumed to have the <route-path> specified here prepended to their corresponding Route Paths.
			router				// The Router to mount to the Express Server Instance.
		);

		app.use(express.static('<directory>'));	// Allow the Express Server Instance to serve Static HTML / CSS / JS Pages within '<directory>', with the URLs mapping to the File Paths of each File, via the default Static Router.

		// express.<router>		// All Router Objects are implicitly attached to the main Express Server Instance.
		
		// Start the Express Server Instance.
		app.listen(
			process.env.PORT || <port>,
			
			// Callback Function that is triggered once Server is running.
			() => {		
				// ...
			}
		);

		// Additional Useful Libaries:
			morgan 				// Produces Logging Middleware Functions.
				morgan('<predefined-format-string>' [, <options-obj>]);
				morgan(':<predefined-tokens> ...') [, <options-obj>];
				morgan((tokens, req, res) => {
					// ...
				} [, <options-obj>]);

			json-parser			// Enables automatic conversion of stringified JSON Content attached in the Request Object into a JS Object, and attaches the result to the Body of the Request Object, for the convenience of downstream Middleware Functions. 

			body-parser			// Produces Body-Parsing Middleware Functions.
