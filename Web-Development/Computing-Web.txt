		XML:					EXtensible Markup Language: A readable implementation-independent data interchange format, used by SOAP.

		SEI:					Service Endpoint Interface. Generates Stubs / Classes that allow an Application to interact with Web Services, given it's WSDL file.	
		
		WSDL:					Web Services Description Language: XML File that describes the Web Service it details (methods, arguments, return types).
		UDDI:					Universal Description, Discovery and Integration: Stores WSDL files for a Web Service.
		
		ESB:					Enterprise Service Bus: Monitors and Routes messages between Web Services and their different versions.

	Concepts:
		Web Site:				A Service hosted on the Web - meant for Humans.
		Web Service:			A Service hosted on the Web - meant for Applications. Advantageous in the interoperability sense. Access the Service's WSDL at a UDDI Directory via SOAP or REST.
		
		Service First:			When the WSDL gets generated after the Web Service is created - not preferable.
		Contract First:			When the WSDL gets generated before the Web Service is created - preferable.
		
		Monolithic -> Client-Server -> {3 || n}-Tier Architecture -> Service Oriented Architecture -> Cloud Service.

		Web Server:				A running (containerized?) Process that listens for incoming requests for information over the Web and sends back HTTP Responses.
		App Server:				Hosts and Exposes Business Logic and Processes.
	
	Details:
		WSDL Format: XML
			Definition:			The Root Element of all WSDL documents, containing all non-Utility elements described below. It defines the name of the Web Service, declares multiple namespaces used throughout the remainder of the document.

			Data types:			The data types to be used in the messages are in the form of XML schemas.

			Message: 			It is an abstract definition of the data, in the form of a message presented either as an entire document or as arguments to be mapped to a method invocation.

			Port type: 			It is an abstract set of operations mapped to one or more end-points, defining the collection of operations for a binding; the collection of operations, as it is abstract, can be mapped to multiple transports through various bindings.
				Operation:		It is the abstract definition of the operation for a message, such as naming a method, message queue, or business process, that will accept and process the message.
			
			Binding: 			It is the concrete protocol and data formats for the operations and messages defined for a particular port type.

			Port: 				It is a combination of a binding and a network address, providing the target address of the service communication.

			Service: 			It is a collection of related end-points encompassing the service definitions in the file; the services map the binding to the port and include any extensibility definitions.
			
			Documentation: 		This utility element is used to provide human-readable documentation and can be included inside any other WSDL element.

			Import:				This utility element is used to import other WSDL documents or XML Schemas.

		Summary of Full-Stack:
			The Front-End of a Web Site or Application consists of the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and static assets sent to a Client, like a Web Browser.

			A Web Server is a running (containerized?) Processthat listens for incoming requests for information over the Web and sends back HTTP Responses.

			Creating, Reading, Updating and Deleting data is a large part of a Web Application’s Back-End. Data is stored in Databases, which can be Relational Databases or NoSQL Databases.

			The Server-Side of a Web Application, sometimes called the Application Server, handles important tasks such as Authentication and Authorization.

			The Back-End of a Web Application often has a Web API which is a way of interacting with an Application’s Data through HTTP Requests and Responses.
			
			Together the technologies used to build the Front-End and Back-End of a Web Application are known as the Stack, and many different Languages and Frameworks can be used to build a robust Back-End.

		RPC: An Architectural Style that models Communication between two Applications as straightforward Function Calls to expose direct Execution Logic.
			An RPC Mechanism usually defines a Network Protocol, some Format for exchanging Messages, a portable way of serializing and deserializing Data and specific Programming Language support (like Code Generators).
			
			Unlike REST, the URLs do not represent Resources, but rather Verbs representing Operations to perform on Resources.
				Example: 
					http://MyRestaurant:8080/Orders/PlaceOrder (POST: {Tacos object})
					http://MyRestaurant:8080/Orders/GetOrder?OrderNumber=asdf (GET)
					http://MyRestaurant:8080/Orders/UpdateOrder (PUT: {Pineapple Tacos object})

				This means that the URLs used per API Call are usually different.

		REST: An Architectural Style to facilitate cleaner communication and interaction between Systems via the Web.
			The core problem is that in the past, it was only necessary to facilitate communication between a small group of Machines in the Business' Local Network to operate. However, it has become increasingly necessary to talk to Machines outside of the Business Network (i.e. other Businesses, etc).

			When HTTP was designed, it was with the intention to allow for communication between Machines anywhere in the world.

			The idea is to represent Concepts / Resources / Nouns as URLs. Any other related Concepts / Resources / Nouns are also stored as URLs. Machines can then use HTTP with the URLs to reach other Machines elsewhere and perform operations on the Concepts / Resources / Nouns.
				Example:
					http://MyRestaurant:8080/Orders/Order?OrderNumber=asdf (POST: {Tacos object})
					http://MyRestaurant:8080/Orders/Order?OrderNumber=asdf (GET)
					http://MyRestaurant:8080/Orders/Order?OrderNumber=asdf (PUT: {Pineapple Tacos object})

				The combination allows for a standardized way of communication between all Entities to refer to things.
					URLs used per API Call can be the same, but the accompanying HTTP Verbs used would result in different effects.

				If the URL contains a Verb, it is an indicator that that URL does not represent a Concept / Resource / Noun.

			Additionally, on the premise that all Web Applications only require 4 Universal Verbs to operate on all things successfully:
				Create / POST
				Read / GET
				Update (Replacement) / PUT
				Update (Partial-Update) / PATCH
				Delete / DELETE

			The structure of the information in the Application has been mapped directly onto a structure of HTTP URLs, using only standard HTTP operations that allow for HTTP body content.

			The implication is that all information that the Server requires to process the Client's Request is in the HTTP Request, and that the Client would get all other related information from the Server alongside the original Client Request, referenced as other URLs.

			Another implication is that the Client and the Server need not know how the other was implemented in order to interact. As long as each side knows what format of messages to send to the other, they can be kept modular and separate.

			This negates the need to store a Session State for tracking purposes, as the 'State' is now transferred between Client Requests and Server Responses.

			Statelessness allows for Scalability, as now any Node in the Network can serve appropriate Client Requests.
