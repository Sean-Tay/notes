Enterprise Web:
	Abbreviations:
		SOA:					Service Oriented Architecture.
		
		RPC:					Remote Procedure Call.

		SOAP:					Single Object Access Protocol: Messaging definition for the interaction between Web Services.
		
		XML:					EXtensible Markup Language: A readable implementation-independent Data interchange format.
		BPEL:					Business Process Execution Language: Specialized XML that links Web Services together.
	
		SEI:					Service Endpoint Interface. Generates Stubs / Classes that allow an Application to interact with Web Services, given it's WSDL file.	
		
		WSDL:					Web Services Description Language: XML File that describes the Web Service it details (Methods, Arguments, Return Types, etc.).
		UDDI:					Universal Description, Discovery and Integration: Stores WSDL files for a Web Service.
		
		ESB:					Enterprise Service Bus: Monitors and Routes messages between Web Services and their different versions.

	Concepts:
		Web Site:				A Service hosted on the Web - meant for Humans.
		Web Service:			A Service hosted on the Web - meant for Applications. Advantageous in the interoperability sense. Access the Service's WSDL at a UDDI Directory via SOAP or REST.
		
		Service First:			When the WSDL gets generated after the Web Service is created - not preferable.
		Contract First:			When the WSDL gets generated before the Web Service is created - preferable.
		
		Monolithic -> Client-Server -> {3 || n}-Tier Architecture -> Service Oriented Architecture -> Cloud Service.
	
	Details:
		WSDL Format: XML
			Definition:			The Root Element of all WSDL documents, containing all non-Utility elements described below. It defines the name of the Web Service, declares multiple namespaces used throughout the remainder of the document.

			Data types:			The Data types to be used in the messages are in the form of XML schemas.

			Message: 			It is an abstract definition of the Data, in the form of a message presented either as an entire document or as arguments to be mapped to a method invocation.

			Port type: 			It is an abstract set of operations mapped to one or more end-points, defining the collection of operations for a binding; the collection of operations, as it is abstract, can be mapped to multiple transports through various bindings.
				Operation:		It is the abstract definition of the operation for a message, such as naming a method, message queue, or business process, that will accept and process the message.
			
			Binding: 			It is the concrete protocol and Data formats for the operations and messages defined for a particular port type.

			Port: 				It is a combination of a binding and a network address, providing the target address of the service communication.

			Service: 			It is a collection of related end-points encompassing the service definitions in the file; the services map the binding to the port and include any extensibility definitions.
			
			Documentation: 		This utility element is used to provide human-readable documentation and can be included inside any other WSDL element.

			Import:				This utility element is used to import other WSDL documents or XML Schemas.
