	Concepts:
		Web Site:				A Service hosted on the Web - meant for Humans.
		Web Service:			A Service hosted on the Web - meant for Applications.

		Web Application:		Generic Term for either a Web Site or Web Service.

		Web Server:				A running Process that listens for incoming Requests for information over the Web and sends back Responses.
		App Server:				Hosts and Exposes Business Logic and Processes.

		URL:					A String that uniquely identifies a Resource / Site / Service on the Web. Consists of:
			Protocol:			The Protocol used to specify the communication mode with the Server.
			Host and Domain:	The Entity that the Server is running on, and the Administrative Space the Entity is in.
			Port:				The Network Port used to interact with the Server Process that is running on the Host.
			Path:				The part that points to a Resource within the Host (i.e. one or more of {"/<simple>" | "/:<parameter>" | "/:<parameter><regex>"}).
			Query:				Optional appended String to the Path that represents URL Arguments in Key-Value Pairs (i.e. <path>/?<key>=<value>& ...).

		Origin: 				Protocol + Host + Domain + Port.

		Routing: 				The process of using URLs to determine the part of the Web Application exposed to the User. Traditionally handled Server-Side.

		JSON:					A readable implementation-independent Data Interchange Format.

		SOAP:					Messaging definition for the interaction between Web Services.
		XML:					A readable implementation-independent Data Interchange Format.
		WSDL:					XML File that describes the Web Service it details (Methods, Arguments, Return Types, etc.).

		Cookie:					A Key-Value Pair Data Structure used to store persistent Session State on the Browser when using Stateless HTTP, set via 'set-cookie' HTTP Response Headers. Each Field Attribute consists of:
			Name:				Field Key.
			Value: 				Field Value.

			Domain:				Determines which Domain can access the associated Field.
			Path:				Determines which part of the Web Application is allowed to access the associated Field.
			Expires / Max Age: 	Determines validity lifespan of the associated Field.
			Size:				Number of characters for associated Field Name and Value.

			// Security-Related Fields:
			HTTP / HttpOnly:	Prevents Client-Side manipulation of the Cookie via JS and other vectors - the Cookie is only used for Server-Side meta-session activity.
			Secure:				Only transmit the assosicated Field over HTTPS.
			SameSite:			Used to prevent CSRF Attacks.

		CSP: 					A backwards-compatable HTTP Response mechanism that allows a Web Application to specify the acceptable types and sources of Resources that can be used by the Client for the Resource currently loaded. This allows increased flexibility from the default Same-Origin only policy whilst still preventing the Web Application from inadvertedly loading malicious Resources from a Third-Party, and is helpful in mitigating Injection Attacks, particularly XSS.
			The Web Application defends against being compromised by its own activity.
	
		CORS:					A HTTP Response mechanism that allows a Web Application running on one Origin to dictate to Clients which Third-Parties running on different Origins can access its Resources, and how they can do so. This allows increased flexibility from the default Same-Origin only policy whilst still preventing unauthorized Third-Parties from potentially doing something malicious to the User with respect to the Web Application.
			The Web Application defends against being compromised by the activity of other Web Applications.

			Pre-flight Request: The requesting Client should send a prior HTTP Request to determine the Web Application's allowance for the actual HTTP Request, before sending the actual HTTP Request (which may cause side effects to the Server - HTTP Methods other than GET, or POST with certain MIME Types). This also gives the Server a chance to specify that the Client should send over credentials as part of the HTTP Request.

	Details:
		Summary of Full-Stack:
			The Front-End of a Web Site or Application consists of the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and static assets sent to a Client, like a Web Browser.

			A Web Server is a running Process that listens for incoming Requests for information over the Web and sends back Responses.

			The Server-Side of a Web Application, sometimes called the Application Server, handles important tasks such as Authentication and Authorization.

			The Back-End of a Web Application often has a Web API which is a way of interacting with an Application’s Data through Requests and Responses.
				Creating, Reading, Updating and Deleting Data is a large part of a Web Application’s Back-End. Operational Processes record Data to Databases via Transactions, and may be accessed from Databases or Data Warehouses.

			Together the technologies used to build the Front-End and Back-End of a Web Application are known as the Stack, and many different Languages and Frameworks can be used to build a robust Back-End.

		RPC: A Mechanism that models Communication between two Processes as straightforward Procedure / Function Calls to exchange Data.
			Details:
				RPC formed the basis for SOAP, which used XML Schema and WSDL to indicate what the Data should contain, and where it should go.

				An RPC Mechanism usually defines a Network Protocol, some Format for exchanging Messages, a portable way of serializing and deserializing Data and specific Programming Language support (like Code Generators).

				It typically involves generating some Function Stubs on the Client Process that makes the Function Call appear local, but behind the stub is logic to marshall the Request and send it to the Server Process.
				The Server Process then unmarshalls the Request and invokes the actual Function before repeating the process in reverse to send whatever the Function returns back to the Client Process. 
				
				RPC's Function Calls are more akin to Verbs representing Operations to perform on Resources. This differs from REST, in which each URL represents a Concept / Noun / Resource.

				RMI is closely related to RPC, but uses Object-Oriented control to execute. This is prevalent in Java.

			Pros:
				Does not require in-depth HTTP knowledge to implement (e.g. every HTTP Request would either be a GET or POST Request).
				Performant without any complex underlying Protocol Layer to get through.

			Cons:
				Special, non-standard Handler required on both Client and Server, which makes RPC more suitable for internal APIs.
				High Coupling between the Client and Server in terms of the API Contract.

			The modern gRPC framework provides additional features:
				Protobuff vs JSON: Protobuff is a more performant alternative to the JSON format.
				Client-Initiated Duplex Streaming Capability vs Request-Response: As a result of leveraging on HTTP 2.0.
				Strong-Typing vs Serialization for Payload Data.
				In-Built Load Balancing.

		REST: An Architectural Style to facilitate cleaner communication and interaction between Systems via the Web.
			The core problem is that in the past, it was only necessary to facilitate communication between a small group of Machines in the Business' Local Network to operate. However, it has become increasingly necessary to talk to Machines outside of the Business Network (i.e. other Businesses, etc).

			When HTTP was designed, it was with the intention to allow for communication between Machines anywhere in the world.

			The idea is to represent Concepts / Resources / Nouns as URLs. Any other related Concepts / Resources / Nouns are also stored as URLs. Machines can then use HTTP with the URLs to reach other Machines elsewhere and perform operations on the Concepts / Resources / Nouns.
				Example:
					http://MyRestaurant:8080/Orders/Order?OrderNumber=asdf (POST: {Tacos object})
					http://MyRestaurant:8080/Orders/Order?OrderNumber=asdf (GET)
					http://MyRestaurant:8080/Orders/Order?OrderNumber=asdf (PUT: {Pineapple Tacos object})

				The combination allows for a standardized way of communication between all Entities to refer to things.
					URLs used per API Call can be the same, but the accompanying HTTP Verbs used would result in different effects.

				If the URL contains a Verb, it is an indicator that that URL does not represent a Concept / Resource / Noun.

			Additionally, on the premise that all Web Applications only require 4 Universal Verbs to operate on all things successfully:
				POST: Accompanying Data is used to modify the Resource represented in the given URI, following the rules documented by the Resource Type.
				PUT: Replace the Resource represented by the given URI, if anything.
				PATCH: Apply this Diff to the Resource, if the Resource has the same State as it did the last time it was queried.
				
				Create / POST
				Read / GET
				Update (Replacement) / PUT
				Update (Partial-Update) / PATCH
				Delete / DELETE

			The structure of the information in the Application has been mapped directly onto a structure of HTTP URLs, using only standard HTTP operations that allow for HTTP body content.

			The implication is that all information that the Server requires to process the Client's Request is in the HTTP Request, and that the Client would get all other related information from the Server alongside the original Client Request, referenced as other URLs.

			Another implication is that the Client and the Server need not know how the other was implemented in order to interact. As long as each side knows what format of Messages to send to the other, they can be kept modular and separate.

			This negates the need to store a Session State for tracking purposes, as the 'State' is now transferred between Client Requests and Server Responses.
				Statelessness allows for Scalability, as now any Node in the Network can serve appropriate Client Requests.
				Statelessness allows for Cacheability.
		
		Web Security:
			HTTP Headers:
				// HTTPS Only:
				// Note: Should be supplemented with automatic redirects to HTTPS connections if a Client attempts to load a URL with the regular HTTP protocol.
					// Server Response Headers:
						Strict-Transport-Security:
							max-age=<expire-time> // The time in seconds that the Client should remember this Strict-Transport-Security configuration for this Site.
							includeSubDomains // Optional Flag to indicate if this rule should apply to sub Network Domains as well.

				// CSP:
					// Server Response Headers:
						Content-Security-Policy: <policy-directive>; ...
							// Note: The more <policy-directive>s specified (including duplicated directives), the more restricted it becomes.
							
							// Policy Directives
								default-src: <source> [<source>]; // Can be seen as a fallback for other Directives if they are not specified. Specify this at the beginning of the Content-Security-Policy Directive string.
									'self' // Specify that all Resources should only originate from the Web Site's own Origin.

								script-src: <source> [<source>]; // Specify the source of JS Resources.
									'self' // Specify that all JS Resources should only originate from the Web Site's own Origin.

									// The following dangerous sources allow for more flexibility, but also increasing degrees to which XSS Attacks can be conducted.
									'unsafe-hashes' // Danger: Allow processing of inline HTML Event Handlers.
									'unsafe-inline' // Danger: Allow processing of inline JS Resources.
									'unsafe-eval' // Danger: Allow processing of JS code specified within Strings.

				// CORS:
					// Reminder: Source (Third-Party) Web Application -> Requesting Resource -> Client -> Request -> Web Application -> Requested Resources.

					// Pre-Flight:
						// Client Request Headers:
							Origin: <url> 
								// Sent by the Client to primarily indicate to the Server the identity of the Source Web Application whose Requesting Resource has made the HTTP Request.
								// Forbidden Header - cannot programmatically change this.
							
							Access-Control-Request-Method: <HTTP-method>
								// Inform the Server the type of interaction the requesting Resource on the Client would want to do with the Requested Resources.
								// Additionally serves to notify the Server that this HTTP Request (along with the OPTIONS HTTP Method specification at the top of the HTTP Request) is a Pre-Flight HTTP Request.
							
							Access-Control-Request-Headers: <custom-HTTP-header>, ... // Specify any custom HTTP Request Headers that the Requesting Resource on the Client might additionally send over.

						// Server Response Headers:
							Access-Control-Allow-Origin: { * | <origin> } // Specify allowed Source Web Applications that can access the Requested Resources.
								// If the allowed Origin is specific, the Server should additionally include a 'Vary' HTTP Response Header to indicate to the Client that the Server Response will differ based on different Origins.

							Access-Control-Allow-Methods: <HTTP-method> // Specify the allowed HTTP Methods that the Server will handle under CORS.

							Access-Control-Allow-Headers: <[custom]-http-header>, ... // Specify any additional custom HTTP Headers (custom or the default CORS safelisted ones) that the Server will accept during a CORS Interaction.

							Access-Control-Max-Age: <delta-seconds>, ... // Indicate the length of time that the results of the CORS Preflight Request can be cached on the Client for, afterwhich another Preflight Request would need to be sent.
								// Note: Certain Browsers will have a maximum Internal Value that they will use instead of the specification if it is longer than the Internal Value.

							Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true // Specify if the actual HTTP Request can be made using supplied Credentials.

					// Actual:
						// Server Response Headers:
							Access-Control-Expose-Headers: <[custom]-http-header>, ... // Specify any additional custom HTTP Headers (custom or the default CORS safelisted ones) that the Server will allow Requesting Resources on Clients to access programmatically.

							Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true // Specify that Credential Cognizant Content for the Web Application should be exposed to the Requesting Resource on the Client, in the scenario where the Requesting Resource of the Source Web Application has enabled the 'withCredentials' Flag in their HTTP Request.
								// Usually the Client will handle the Credential Cognizant Content, and direct accesses by loaded Resources to the Authentication Information will be blocked. Specifying this will allow the Requesting Resource on the Client to be able to access the Credential Cognizant Content. 

								// Note: This also requires that the Access-Control-Allow-Origin Header have a specific <origin> value, rather than the '*' wildcard.

								// Note: Omit this if it should not be exposed.
