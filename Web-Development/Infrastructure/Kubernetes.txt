Kubernetes:
	Abbreviations: 
	
	Description: A Platform for running many Containers on the Cloud.
	
	Resources: 
	
	Concepts: 
		Release: An Application Image / Container to be deployed onto a Kubernetes Cluster.

		Manifest: A YAML File that describes the desired state of a Resource.
		Resource: An Object that describes a desired state for the Release.

	Details:
		Components:
			Label: 				Name Tags to identify entities, or to define different attributes.
				Querying can be done on these Labels in a Kubernetes Environment.

			Pod: 				A runnable unit of work which can contain many Containers that support each other and are tightly coupled.
				Kubernetes will connect this Pod to the overall network, and the rest of the Kubernetes ecosystem.

			Node:				A Machine with a Container Runtime that can run Pods.

			Cluster: 			A group of Nodes with the same configuration.

			Replication Controller: Provides a Pod Template, which can create any number of Pod Templates.

			k8s Service: 		Tells the rest of the Kubernetes Environment, including other Pods and Replication Controllers, what Services does the Application provide.
					Defines a fixed Network Address for the Application so that other Applications can interact with the Application.

					Features:
						Persistent
						Load Balancing

			Volume: 			Persistent or Ephemeral Storage Backend where Applications can store information.
					From the perspective of the Application, it appears to be on the local filesystem.

					Types:
						Mounted
						Cloud

			Namespace: 			Segments a group of Pods, Replication Controllers, Volumes, and other secrets, from each other.
					A degree of isolation from each other.

		Other Tools:
			Helm: 				Package Manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the deployment and management of Application Images on Kubernetes Clusters.
			OpenShift:			Container Application Platform that extends Kubernetes to provide Enterprise-level Features and Security.
