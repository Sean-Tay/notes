Kubernetes:
	Abbreviations: 
	
	Description: A Platform for running many Containers on the Cloud.
	
	Resources: 
	
	Concepts: 
		Release: 				An instance of a Manifest running in a Kubernetes Cluster.

		Manifest: 				A YAML File that describes the desired state of a Resource.
		Resource: 				An Object that describes a desired state for the Release.

		Containers:				An isolated environment in which a Runtime Executable can run in.
		Pods:					A runnable unit of work which can contain many Containers that support each other and are tightly coupled. Kubernetes will connect this Pod to the overall network, and the rest of the Kubernetes ecosystem.
			Liveness Probe		Indicates if the Pod is able to run. Restart the Pod if not true.
			Readiness Probe		Indicates if the Pod is able to serve Requests. Reroutes Requests from the Pod to other ready Pods while not true.
			Startup Probe		Delays Liveness and Readiness Probe Checks while Pod is starting up.

		Job:					Manages running a Pod to complete a finite task.
		Cronjob:				A scheduled Job.

		Replication Controller: An older variant of the Replica Set.
		Replica Set:			Ensures a specified number of Pods (of the same type) are active.
		Deployment:				A higher-level abstraction over Replica Sets, supporting features such as Rolling Updates / Rollbacks.

	Details:
		Components:
			Label: 				Name Tags to identify entities, or to define different attributes.
				Querying can be done on these Labels in a Kubernetes Environment.

			Node:				A Machine with a Container Runtime that can run Pods.

			Cluster: 			A group of Nodes with the same configuration.

			k8s Service: 		Tells the rest of the Kubernetes Environment, including other Pods and Replication Controllers, what Services does the Application provide.
					Defines a fixed Network Address for the Application so that other Applications can interact with the Application.

					Features:
						Persistent
						Load Balancing

			Volume: 			Persistent or Ephemeral Storage Backend where Applications can store information.
					From the perspective of the Application, it appears to be on the local filesystem.

					Types:
						Mounted
						Cloud

			Namespace: 			Segments a group of Pods, Replication Controllers, Volumes, and other secrets, from each other.
					A degree of isolation from each other.

		Other Tools:
			Helm: 				Package Manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the deployment and management of Application Images on Kubernetes Clusters.
			OpenShift:			Container Application Platform that extends Kubernetes to provide Enterprise-level Features and Security.
	
	Commands:
		kubectl
			get deployments
			scale deployment <deployment-name> --replicas=<n>

			get pods
			get jobs / cronjobs
				-o wide			# See Images used in the Pod / Job / Cronjob
			
			exec -it <pod-id> -- /bin/bash # Execute /bin/bash in target Pod
			logs <pod-id>		# Examine Logs from target Pod
