	Concepts: 
		Cronjob 				- A Shell Script that gets executed periodically.
	
	Details:
		Hint: Try using Git Bash in Environments that don't have Bash by default.

		Metadata:
			File Permissions: For executable jobs defined in script, need to set the eXecutable bit.
				- File Type {- | d | c | l | p | s | b | D} (1)
					- Regular Files	: -
					- Directory		: d
				
				- You (3), Group (3), Others (3)
					- Readability (0, 1), Writability (0, 1), Executability (0, 1, S for Root User Execution).

				- Intepretation:
					- Directories:
						- Readability - Allows affected User to List Files within the Directory.
						- Writability - Allows affected User to Create, Rename or Delete Files within the Directory, as well as modify the Directory Attributes.
						- Executability - Allows affected User to enter the Directory.
						- Sticky - Files or Directories within may only be Renamed or Deleted by their Owners.

		Standard IO:
			stdin				- Considered as file at /dev/stdin
			stdout				- Considered as file at /dev/stdout
				- 				- Alias to reference stdout. Useful when piping.

		Tips:
			1. Use absolute filepaths when referencing files: "$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" >/dev/null && pwd )/file"
			2. Encapsulate content of each Sourceable Script within a Function, and then call that Function at the end of the Sourceable Script.
			3. For Commands that accept <file> inputs:
				a. stdin and stdout are also considered as 'files'.
				b. '|' operator redirects LHS command stdout to RHS command stdin.
				c. Don't pipe from the ls Command - use either Glob Patterns or find.
		
	Commands:
		Note: Command arguments are always separated with spaces.

		. ./<command> [<args>, ...] - Execute executable <command> in the current shell.
		./<command> [<args>, ...] - Execute executable <command> in a child shell.
		
		: 						- Dummy Command
		
		Execution Flow: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/159513/what-are-the-shells-control-and-redirection-operators
			<command1> ; <command2>	- Execute <command2> after <command1> finishes.
			<command> ... &		- Run <command> in the background.
			<command1> & <command2>	- Execute <command1> in background and <command2> in foreground.
			
			<command1> && <command2> - Execute <command2> only if <command1> exits 0 / succeeds.
			<command1> || <command2> - Execute <command2> only if <command1> exits 1 / fails.
			! <command>			- Negate the success outcome of <command>.
			
			<command1> | <command2>	- Chain <command1> stdout to <command2> stdin.
			<command1> |& <command2> - Chain <command1> stdout and stderr to <command2> stdin.
			
			( <command1> ... ) - Execute <command> in a subshell.
			` <command1> ... ` - Command Substitution: Execute <command> in a subshell, and return the Exit Code of the last executed <command> back.
			$( <command1> ... ) - Command Substitution: Execute <command> in a subshell and return the output of the last executed <command> back.
			<( <command1> ... ) - Process Substitution: Execute <command> in a subshell and return the output of the last executed <command> back as a File Handle, avoiding the need to explicitly create temp Files. Note: Not supported by Pure Shell (use Bash to execute).
			
			{ <command1> ... } - Group Command: Execute <command> with the current shell.
			
			<command> < <source1> ... - Receive input from <source>.
			<command> <> <target1> ... - Receive input from <target> into <command>, and send <command> output back to <target>.
			
			<command> <stream_name> > <target1> ... - Send output in <stream_name> generated by <command> to <target>, overwriting prior content.
			<command> <stream_name> >> <target1> ... - Send output in <stream_name> generated by <command> to <target>, preserving prior content.

		General:
			getconf ARG_MAX		- Obtain maximum length of argument to the exec functions, including environment data.

					- echo
					- printf
				- Certain external commands, such as xargs and find are aware of ARG_MAX variable and repeatedly perform actions under that limit.

			xargs <command>		- Reads in stdin and converts the content into arguments for the succeeding <command>.
				# Tip: <command> can be: sh -c ' <command-1>; <command-2>; ... ' to allow execution of multiple Commands. -I's <placeholder> works as is.

				-maxdepth 0		- Do not traverse into Directories. Specify immediately after <filepath>.
				-prune			- If a Directory is found, do not descend into it.

				-type <type> 	- Specify the type of Files / Directories to process.

				-p				- Preserve permissions and ownership when copying.

				-a 				- Copy <fileA> exactly as they are (archive).
			
			mv <fileA> <fileB>	- Move or Rename <fileA> as <fileB>. If <fileB> is present, it will be overriden.

					- Note: Does not store and preserve permissions and ownership of intermediate directories when used with the -p option, unless they are explicitly added in.
					- Note: For --exclude, if specifying a Directory, do not end with a '/'.
					- Tip: For --exclude, if only one item, just equate to one string and not an array.
